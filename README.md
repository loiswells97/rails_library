# rails_library ðŸ“š

This is a Rails app that implements a basic library.

## Setup

The app is set up by running `docker compose build` followed by `docker compose up`

## Functionality

### Books

Information about books can be created, read, updated and deleted. Books can also be searched and added to lists. 

### Lists

Lists can be created for the purpose of categorising books. There is a many-to-many relationship between books and lists so that a given book can belong to multiple categories. Default lists include `Favourites` and `Up next` and there are also two autogenerated lists: `In progress` and `Recent reads` which cannot be modified.
